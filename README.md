# Weather_SMS_notification_app
This application fetches the weather data (https://www.weatherapi.com/) for a given location and checks if there will be rain throughout the day. If yes, an SMS message is sent to your phone number in the morning, so that you do not forget your umbrella. :) 

The goal of the project is to further show the capabilities of APIs. The focus here is on;
- the extraction of JSON data from a response to a GET request
- configuring an SMS messaging service (https://www.twilio.com/) to automatically send a message to your phone every morning if rain is on the forecast.
